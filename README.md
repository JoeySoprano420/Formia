# Formia

This language is:

âœ… Human-readable (with intuitive syntax)

âœ… Machine-executable (mapped directly to NASM x64 without any need for conversion layers)

âœ… Stylistically structured, usable for outlines, diagrams, and control logic

âœ… Macro-expandable via |...| (supports contextually inferred abstraction macro scripts: C.I.A.M.S.)



ğŸ–¥ Execution Notes
This language can compile directly to NASM using the chart.

Every structure uses a clean visual format, readable like an outline but executable like assembly.

Tools can parse FORMIA line-by-line, tokenize via provided symbols (=, :, ->, Return) and emit directly into .asm, .hex, or .bin.
