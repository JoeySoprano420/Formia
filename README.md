# Formia

This language is:

✅ Human-readable (with intuitive syntax)

✅ Machine-executable (mapped directly to NASM x64 without any need for conversion layers)

✅ Stylistically structured, usable for outlines, diagrams, and control logic

✅ Macro-expandable via |...| (supports contextually inferred abstraction macro scripts: C.I.A.M.S.)
